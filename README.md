This repository contains firstly our written lab report, an excel file which contains the exploratory testing on sheet 1 and manual functional testing and regression testing on sheet 2. As well we have provided screenshots of our Jira Overview Page and and example of our Jira bug tracking in Appendix A including the function, reproducibility, status, and how we have compared the expected output with the actual output.
