This repository contains firstly our written lab report, an excel file which contains the exploratory testing on sheet 1 and manual functional testing on sheet 2.
As well we have provided screenshots of our Jira Overview Page and and example of our Jira bug tracking description including the function, reproducibility, status, and how we have compared the expected output with the actual output. In addition, we have shared the Jira Project with our TA (Sujesh Padhi) as well as the head TA for Assignment 1 (Somayeh Modaberi).
